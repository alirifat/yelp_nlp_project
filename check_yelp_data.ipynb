        "  Online customer reviews can be defined as comments or opinions on a specific product which are posted on company or a third-party website by the peers ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20721420?seq=1)). Moreover, they can be seen as an outcome of a customer’s experience with a product, as well as, an input for a potential customer’s buying process. For this reason, customer reviews should not be considered as a narrow two-way relationship between the customer and the brand but they may result a greater effect on the business performance by affecting potential customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The consumer buying process consists of the following steps: problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision and postpurchase behavior ([Kotler and Keller, 2016](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Kotler-Marketing-Management-15th-Edition/9780133856460.html?tab=overview)). Consumers may not go through each step anytime they purchase a product. However, depending on the importance of the purchase, prior experience etc., they will go through several steps in the process including information search and postpurchase behavior. Accordingly, customer reviews will be one of the main sources of collecting information for the potential buyers and an important medium for the customers who would like to share their experiences with the product and purchasing process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  On the other hand, in the information search process, customers would like to access word-of-mouth (WOM) in order to mitigate uncertainty and perceived risk ([Xie etc., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027843191400125X)). In the traditional way, WOM is done by contacting friends, peers, people who have experience with the product etc. However, as e-commerce being prevalent, online customer reviews can be considered as a part of WOM and can be defined as eWOM (electronic word-of-mouth ([Bronner and Hoog, 2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0047287509355324)). \n"

        "As discussed in the above section, customer reviews are one of the main source of information for potential buyers on the internet. However, a company have to do more than just presenting the customer reviews to the potential buyers. As the number of customer reviews grows, the amount of resources that potential buyers have to allocate in order to complete the purchasing process also grows. Moreover, low-quality reviews can change the mind of potential buyer and can cause a loss of business relationships. For this reason, it is essential for a business to select and present helpful reviews in order to build and sustain profitable relationships with customers ([Park, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/6/1735)).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), orders the customer reviews based on their helpfulness and ask each reader to vote if the review was helpful. It is possible to determine the helpfulness of customer reviews manually by other customers. However, this kind of an approach comes with its own caveats. Firstly, potential buyers and/or consumers mostly will not be able to spend the required amount of time to read all customer reviews and vote them. Secondly, most of reviews will not be voted (as we will see in the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) dataset, .. % have less than 5 votes). Last but not least, the amount of time that is spent for a review to be recognized as helpful can vary greatly and can cause loss of potential business relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, predicting helpfulness of customer reviews gives business the control over the customer reviews by promoting the most possible helpful review as the review enters the pool of reviews. It is also convenient for the potential buyers since it reduces the search for material information about the product significantly. Finally, it increases the efficiency of the dataset by going through each customer reviews instead of focusing a narrow number of reviews."

            "\n",
            "-8 pm on a Saturday night, three tables are occupied\n",
            "-a sign on the door indicates they're looking for an experienced line cook, a dishwasher, waitresses, you name it\n",
            "-Pita Jungle, just a stone's throw away, is packed to the gills\n",
            "\n",
            "These are all bad signs.  They go ignored, however, because I'd eaten one thing all day, and I had drove here to try their pizza.  Never, ever again.\n",
            "\n",
            "The waitress brings me out a water and a menu to my table for one  on the patio, which I had all to myself.  Browsing the apps, I was pleasantly surprised to see several things priced $3, which seemed like a bargain, given the high price of everything else.  $3 tapanade sounded like a good deal, but I was informed that it didn't come with anything - it was $3 extra for bread.  Since I was solo, I decided to skip it and instead pay $14 for their 12\" margherita pizza.  \n",
            "\n",
            "About three minutes later, the waitress drops off my pizza.  \"Your pizza\", she says, leaves a plate and off she goes.  I sat for a moment, confused as to how things happened so quickly.  I try to grab a slice of the pizza, but it was so blazing hot that I wasn't even going to attempt to handle it.  I waited for a few minutes to let it cool off, only to discover that not only had it cooled enough to handle, but was actually well-cooled and most likely reheated.  After a closer inspection of the pie in front of me, it was evident that it had been reheated, as there were smaller tomatoes that had spent their time in the oven, and larger tomatoes that had barely been kissed by the heat of the oven.\n",
            "\n",
            "I took a bite, and was immediately underwhelmed.  The crust had very little character, was slightly sweet but had that store-bought quality to it.  The pesto tasted okay, but the tomatoes were completely tasteless and overall, it just fell flat.  It's margherita - the ingredients need to shine to make such a simple pizza.  These ingredients were sub-par.  After two small pieces, I decided I was wasting my calories and just gave up on it.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I sat outside, not eating, and sat.  And sat.  Where the hell was the waitress?  I glanced inside a few times, hoping to catch her eye, but she must have been occupied elsewhere.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The owner comes out.  \"How'd you like your pizza?\"  Instead of immediately responding, I asked how it had come out so quickly.  In short, he told me another table had ordered it, decided they didn't want it, and it sat in the kitchen for two minutes, who in turn decided to send it out to me since I didn't order anything else.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Me: \"Well, it didn't really taste fresh\".\n",
            "Him: \"No, no, our pizzas are the best.  Ask our customers.  You're the first person since we've opened to ever not like our pizzas\".  \n",
            "\n",
            "He got very defensive about the pizza, but I hadn't really launched a harsh criticism on the pizza, just said I didn't really enjoy it.  So I sat some more, with an empty drink, and realized they wanted me gone.  The owner wouldn't make eye contact with me.  The server never came back out asking if I wanted something else.  And they still hadn't refilled my drink.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I sat on a patio, alone, and decided to have a smoke.  The waitress comes out...\n",
            "\n",
            "Her: \"Sir, there's a no smoking sign over there, I was told to tell you to not to smoke here.\"  \n",
            "Me: \"Is this the last f*** you in this experience?\"\n",
            "Her: \"Yes, I think so\".\n",
            "\n",
            "She walks away.  I walk inside, pay the bill, and leave.  No apologies, no discounts on the bill, nothing.  $18 for weak iced tea and shitty pizza.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is arrogance in its worst form.  I can forgive bad food, but I cannot forgive misplaced arrogance and the blatant dismissal of a customer, whether you agree with them or not.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the sign on the door should also say, \"Wanted: New owner\".  \n",

Working in a family business myself and knowing it is never easy, I wondered if owners Amy and Samy could possibly be like they were portrayed on the show or if there was some fancy editing done on the show.  Knowing that reality TV is usually far from reality, off we went last Saturday night for dinner at Amy's Baking Company.\n",

Plans changed and by Saturday night our group had grown to seven but I was reluctant to call and advise them of the change.  I was a little nervous....would they be mad?  Would Samy yell at me?  Silly questions, I know but legitimate ones after watching the show.   He really is a nice guy and I was silly to think otherwise.

Samy had advised us because our party was so big that the food might take a little longer because Amy was preparing everything fresh.  I can tell you that the food service was fast.  We had our appetizers in under 10 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "We next ordered our entrees.  Our food came to us in about 15 minutes or so.  Amy made every item we ordered herself and let me tell you, she can cook!   \n",

            "I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Penne Pasta.  The chicken breast was large and nicely breaded.  The marinara was perfect, not too tangy and not too sweet.  Underneath the layer of cheese were nice large basil leaves.  This really added nicely to the flavor.  The penne was fabulous as well, buttered and spiced nicely.\n",
            " \n",
            "My husband ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and boy was it good.  Very creamy and delicious and a nice sized portion, enough to eat some and take home.  I'm having the leftovers for lunch today and can't wait!  Amy was nice enough to advise us on how to reheat it so that it was just as tasty as when it was freshly made.\n",
            "\n",
            "My favorite items that were ordered at our table were Amy's pizzas.  My sister ordered the Garlic Chicken Mushroom pizza and our friends ordered the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, half of it made spicy.  Both pizzas had a wonderful crust which was thin with a perfect mix of crispness on the outside and softness in the center.  These were perfectly cooked.  The spicy sausage and pepperoni pizza was so good that I can't wait to go back.  The initial bite wasn't that spicy, but then it hits you and tingles your lips and tongue.  The spice was unlike anything I've had on pizza and it was so incredible.  The Garlic Chicken Mushroom was wonderful too, perfectly balanced flavors and very fresh.  The cheese and herbs on the pizza made for a nice bite.  Amy really knows how to cook a tasty pizza.  She checked in with us to see how we liked everything.  Our tables was thrilled with the food.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last but not least, we ordered dessert.  I had the best key lime pie of my life and my husband has a chocolate truffle cake, topped with mousse and covered in chocolate.  That cake was so rich and wonderful.  Her desserts are divine.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of our meal, Amy and Samy were gracious enough to take pictures with our entire table.  They really are a lovely couple.  They are very nice people with a passion for their restaurant.  It was a pleasure to meet them in real life and not just make assumptions on who they were based on what we saw on TV.\n",

            "We had such a wonderful visit to Amy's Baking Company that I find it hard to believe much of anything I saw on Kitchen Nightmares.  For this reason, I say you shouldn't judge the place until you try it.    \n",
            "\n",

I waited for a few minutes to let it cool off, only to discover that not only had it cooled enough to handle, but was actually well-cooled and most likely reheated.  After a closer inspection of the pie in front of me, it was evident that it had been reheated, as there were smaller tomatoes that had spent their time in the oven, and larger tomatoes that had barely been kissed by the heat of the oven.\n",

The pesto tasted okay, but the tomatoes were completely tasteless and overall, it just fell flat.  It's margherita - the ingredients need to shine to make such a simple pizza.
